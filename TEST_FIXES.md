# Test Results - RPE Matching & Customer Extraction Fixes

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Both issues fixed

---

## **Issue 1: RPE Variant Matching**

### **Problem:**
- Email: "C-40-20-RPE Doctor Blades"
- System matched: `C-40-20-2°` (wrong variant)
- Should match: `C-40-20-RPE` (exact match)

### **Root Cause:**
Code extraction pattern prioritized base codes before full variant codes.

### **Fix:**
Updated `vector_store.py` line 374 to prioritize full variant codes:

```python
code_patterns = [
    r'\b([A-Z]-\d{2,4}-\d{2,4}-[A-Z]+)\b',   # C-40-20-RPE (FULL variant) ✓ NEW
    r'\b([A-Z]+\d{3,4}[A-Z]?)\b',            # SDS025, L1520
    r'\b(3M\s+[A-Z]?\d{3,4})\b',             # 3M L1520
    r'\b([A-Z]-\d{2,4}-\d{2,4})\b',          # C-40-20 (base code)
]
```

### **Test Result:**
```
Input: "C-40-20-RPE Doctor Blades - 100 meter coil"
[L0] Code extracted from name: 'C-40-20-RPE'  ← Exact code now!
[L1] ✓ Exact code match: C-40-20-RPE (100%)
Match: C-40-20-RPE - Doctor Blade Carbon 40x0,20 mm / RPE ✓
```

### **Available C-40-20 Variants:**
```
C-40-20-2°       - Doctor Blade Carbon 40x0,20 2°
C-40-20-3°       - Doctor Blade Carbon 40x0,20 3°
C-40-20-RPE      - Doctor Blade Carbon 40x0,20 mm / RPE ✓ NOW MATCHED
C-40-20-RPE-L1335 - Doctor Blade Carbon 40x0,20 mm / RPE / L1335 mm
C-40-20-RPE-L1280 - Doctor Blade Carbon 40x0,20 mm / RPE / L1280 mm
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Now matches exact variant with RPE suffix

## **Issue 2: SDS as Customer (Wrong!)**

### **Problem:**
- Email from: Customer ordering from SDS
- System extracted: "SDS GmbH" as customer
- **Wrong!** SDS is the SELLER, not the buyer!

### **Root Cause:**
Extraction prompt didn't explicitly exclude SDS as customer.

### **Fix:**
Updated both prompts to exclude SDS:

**extraction_prompt_v2.txt (lines 9-13):**
```
⚠️ IMPORTANT - SELLER vs BUYER:
- **SDS GmbH / SDS-Print** is the SELLER (that's us!) - DO NOT extract as customer
- The customer is the company ORDERING FROM SDS, not SDS itself
- Look for: "Besteller" (orderer), "Kunde" (customer)
- IGNORE: "Lieferant" (supplier), any mention of SDS as recipient
```

**extraction_prompt.txt (lines 13-16):**
```
- **SDS GmbH / SDS-Print** is the SELLER (that's us!) - DO NOT extract as customer
- NEVER extract "SDS GmbH" or "SDS-Print" as the customer
```

### **Test Required:**
Re-run the same email that extracted "SDS GmbH" as customer and verify it now extracts the actual buyer.

**Expected Behavior:**
- If email is from Mark Surujbali ordering FROM SDS
- System should extract: Mark Surujbali's company (the buyer)
- System should NOT extract: SDS GmbH

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Prompts updated to exclude SDS

## **Summary of Changes**

### **Files Modified:**

1. **`retriever_module/vector_store.py`** (line 374)
   - Added pattern for full variant codes with suffixes (RPE, etc.)
   - Prioritizes exact matches before base code variants

2. **`prompts/extraction_prompt_v2.txt`** (lines 9-26)
   - Added explicit warning about SDS being the seller
   - Instructions to never extract SDS as customer
   - Clarified buyer vs seller identification

3. **`prompts/extraction_prompt.txt`** (lines 13-18)
   - Same SDS exclusion logic for V1 prompt
   - Maintains backward compatibility

---

## **Testing Checklist**

- [x] Test RPE exact matching
- [x] Verify RPE matches C-40-20-RPE not C-40-20-2°
- [ ] Test email with SDS as seller (verify customer extraction)
- [ ] Run main.py with test email
- [ ] Verify order created with correct customer

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Run `python main.py` to test with a real email
2. Verify customer extraction excludes SDS
3. Verify RPE products match exactly
4. Check order creation uses correct customer ID

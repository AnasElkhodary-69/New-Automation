# SDS007 Product Matching Issue - Root Cause Analysis & Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Issue**: Fine-tuned BERT model was returning wrong products (SDS2573 Foam Seal) instead of correct products (SDS007H/SDS007C Duro Seal)

---

## Root Cause Identified

### Problem
When searching for "DuroSeal W&H End Seals Miraflex SDS 007 CR Grau", the fine-tuned BERT model returned:

1. **SDS2573** (Foam Seal) - **93.82% similarity** ❌ WRONG
2. **SDS007H** (Duro Seal) - **93.04% similarity** ✓ CORRECT

**Why was the wrong product scoring higher?**

### Analysis

1. **Training Pair Generation Flaw**:
   - Both SDS007H ("Duro Seal") and SDS2573 ("Foam Seal") are SDS products
   - Original `_are_similar_products()` logic considered them SIMILAR because:
     - Same category: `SDS`
     - Both have material: `seal`
   - This created POSITIVE training pairs teaching BERT they are interchangeable

2. **Text Similarity**:
   - Customer query: "DuroSeal W&H **End Seals** Miraflex"
   - SDS007H: "**Duro Seal** W&H Miraflex"
   - SDS2573: "**Foam Seal** OTTURATORE"
   - The word "Seal" appears in all three → high semantic similarity

3. **Verification**:
   ```bash
   python analyze_sds2573_issue.py
   ```

   **Result**:
   ```
   Would these be POSITIVE training pairs? True  ← PROBLEM!
   ```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Seal Sub-type Detection

**File**: `retriever_module/bert_finetuner.py`

Added seal sub-type extraction to distinguish different seal products:

```python
# Extract seal sub-type for distinguishing different seal products
seal_subtype = None
if 'seal' in text_lower or 'dichtung' in text_lower:
    if 'duro seal' in text_lower or 'duroseal' in text_lower:
        seal_subtype = 'duro_seal'
    elif 'foam seal' in text_lower or 'schaumstoff' in text_lower:
        seal_subtype = 'foam_seal'
    elif 'end seal' in text_lower or 'enddichtung' in text_lower:
        seal_subtype = 'end_seal'
    elif 'side seal' in text_lower or 'seitendichtung' in text_lower:
        seal_subtype = 'side_seal'
```

**Results**:
- SDS007H → `seal_subtype: 'duro_seal'`
- SDS2573 → `seal_subtype: 'foam_seal'`

### 2. Updated Similarity Logic

Modified `_are_similar_products()` to enforce seal sub-type matching:

```python
# CRITICAL: If both have seal sub-types, they MUST match
# This prevents Duro Seal from being matched with Foam Seal
if feat1['seal_subtype'] and feat2['seal_subtype']:
    if feat1['seal_subtype'] != feat2['seal_subtype']:
        return False  # Different seal types = NOT similar
```

**Verification After Fix**:
```bash
python test_seal_detection.py
```

**Result**:
```
SDS007H - seal_subtype: duro_seal
SDS2573 - seal_subtype: foam_seal
Are they similar? False  ← FIXED!
```

### 3. Added Explicit Negative Training Pairs

Added Strategy 3 to training pair generation:

```python
# Strategy 3: Generate explicit negative pairs for different seal types
# This is CRITICAL to prevent Duro Seal from matching with Foam Seal
logger.info("Generating explicit seal sub-type negative pairs...")

seal_products_by_type = {}
for prod in self.products:
    feat = self._extract_product_features(prod)
    if feat['seal_subtype']:
        if feat['seal_subtype'] not in seal_products_by_type:
            seal_products_by_type[feat['seal_subtype']] = []
        seal_products_by_type[feat['seal_subtype']].append(prod)

# Create negative pairs between different seal types
seal_types = list(seal_products_by_type.keys())
for i, type1 in enumerate(seal_types):
    for type2 in seal_types[i+1:]:
        # Sample products from each type
        prods1 = seal_products_by_type[type1]
        prods2 = seal_products_by_type[type2]

        for prod1 in random.sample(prods1, min(5, len(prods1))):
            for prod2 in random.sample(prods2, min(2, len(prods2))):
                # Very low similarity (0.0-0.2) for different seal types
                score = random.uniform(0.0, 0.2)
                negative_pairs.append(InputExample(
                    texts=[text1, text2],
                    label=score
                ))
```

This explicitly teaches BERT that:
- **Duro Seal ≠ Foam Seal** (similarity: 0.0-0.2)
- **Duro Seal ≠ End Seal** (similarity: 0.0-0.2)
- **Foam Seal ≠ Side Seal** (similarity: 0.0-0.2)
- etc.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Fine-tuning requires domain-specific logic**:
   - Generic "same category" logic is insufficient
   - Need to distinguish product sub-types even within same category

2. **Explicit negative pairs are crucial**:
   - Teaching what products are NOT similar is as important as teaching what IS similar
   - Prevents semantic overgeneralization

3. **Validation is critical**:
   - Always test fine-tuned models with real queries
   - Check if wrong products are scoring higher than correct ones
   - Verify training pair generation produces expected pairs

4. **Text normalization still matters**:
   - "DuroSeal" vs "Duro Seal" (space variation)
   - "CR Grau" vs "CR-GRY" (language/format variation)
   - BERT handles these well, but explicit augmentation helps

# BERT Fine-tuning for Product Matching

## Overview

Fine-tuning trains the BERT model specifically on **your product catalog** (2025 products) to dramatically improve matching accuracy.

## Why Fine-tune?

### Current Problem:
- Generic BERT doesn't understand your domain-specific terminology
- Customer product codes (9000841, 9000826) don't match your internal codes (L1335, E1015, etc.)
- Generic terms like "Doctor Blade" match to wrong products
- Low confidence scores (61%) even for obvious matches

### After Fine-tuning:
- ✅ Learns your product categories (L=blades, E=mounting, SDS=seals, etc.)
- ✅ Understands dimension patterns specific to your products
- ✅ Maps customer terminology to your product codes
- ✅ Higher confidence scores for correct matches
- ✅ Better handling of German ↔ English product names

## How It Works

The fine-tuning process:

1. **Generates Training Pairs** from your 2025 products:
   - **Positive pairs**: Similar products (same category, similar dimensions)
   - **Negative pairs**: Different products (different categories)
   - **Augmented pairs**: Variations of the same product description

2. **Trains the Model** using Contrastive Learning:
   - Similar products → High similarity score (0.8-1.0)
   - Different products → Low similarity score (0.0-0.3)
   - Model learns to distinguish between your product types

3. **Saves Fine-tuned Model**:
   - Saved to `models/finetuned-product-matcher/`
   - Automatically used by the system

## Training Strategy

### Positive Pairs (Similar Products):
```
Product 1: "G-35-20-RPE-L1328" - Doctor Blade Gold 35x0.20 RPE L1328
Product 2: "G-35-20-RPE-L1335" - Doctor Blade Gold 35x0.20 RPE L1335
→ Similarity: 0.95 (same category, same dimensions, different length)
```

### Negative Pairs (Different Products):
```
Product 1: "G-35-20-RPE-L1328" - Doctor Blade Gold
Product 2: "SDS2601" - Foam Seal 120x31
→ Similarity: 0.1 (different category, different product type)
```

### Augmented Pairs (Same Product):
```
Original: "L1335 Doctor Blade Stainless Steel Gold 35x0.20 RPE L1335mm"
Variation 1: "L1335"
Variation 2: "Doctor Blade 35x0.20 RPE L1335"
Variation 3: "doctor blade stainless steel gold 35x0,20 rpe l1335mm"
→ All match to original with 0.95+ similarity
```

## How to Train

### Step 1: Run Training Script

```bash
python train_bert_model.py
```

The script will:
- **Automatically detect and use GPU (CUDA) if available** for training (3-10 min)
- **Fall back to CPU** if no GPU (10-30 min)
- Generate ~6000-10000 training pairs from your products
- Train for 3 epochs
- Save fine-tuned model to `models/finetuned-product-matcher/`
- Show evaluation results with test queries

**Important**: Training uses GPU (if available) for speed, but the saved model works on **CPU in production**.

### Step 2: Automatic Usage

The system **automatically detects and uses** the fine-tuned model:
- If `models/finetuned-product-matcher/` exists → Use fine-tuned model
- Otherwise → Use base model (Alibaba-NLP/gte-modernbert-base)

No code changes needed!

### Step 3: Test Improved Matching

```bash
python main.py
```

Compare the matching results to see improved scores.

## Training Parameters

You can adjust training parameters in `train_bert_model.py`:

```python
finetuner.fine_tune(
    epochs=3,        # Training epochs (3 is default, more = better but slower)
    batch_size=16,   # Batch size (reduce if out of memory)
    warmup_steps=100 # Learning rate warmup
)
```

### Recommended Settings:

| Dataset Size | Epochs | Batch Size | Time (GPU) | Time (CPU) |
|-------------|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| 2000 products | 3 | 16 | 3-5 min | 15-20 min |
| 2000 products | 5 | 16 | 5-10 min | 25-35 min |
| 2000 products | 3 | 32 | 2-4 min | N/A (CPU OOM) |

**Note**: GPU training is 5-7x faster than CPU!

## Expected Improvements

### Before Fine-tuning:
```
Query: "9000841 Doctor Blade Stainless Steel Gold 35x0.20 RPE"
Match: [61%] C-40-20-RPE-L1335 (WRONG - dimensions don't match)
```

### After Fine-tuning:
```
Query: "9000841 Doctor Blade Stainless Steel Gold 35x0.20 RPE"
Match: [87%] G-35-20-RPE-L1335 (CORRECT - exact match!)
```

### Confidence Score Improvements:
- **Correct matches**: 61% → 85-95%
- **Wrong matches**: 61% → 30-40% (properly rejected)
- **No match**: Returns nothing instead of wrong match

## What Gets Learned

The model learns:

1. **Product Categories**:
   - `L`, `G`, `C` = Doctor Blades (different materials)
   - `E` = Mounting tapes
   - `SDS` = Special products
   - `RPR`, `RPS` = Blade types

2. **Dimension Patterns**:
   - `35x0.20` = width x thickness
   - `L1335` = length in mm
   - `310x25` = tape dimensions

3. **Material Types**:
   - Stainless Steel, Carbon, Gold
   - Foam, Rubber, Adhesive
   - OPP, 3M, TESA brands

4. **German ↔ English Mapping**:
   - Rakelmesser ↔ Doctor Blade
   - Klebeband ↔ Adhesive Tape
   - Dichtung ↔ Seal

```

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory Error:
```python
# Reduce batch size in train_bert_model.py
finetuner.fine_tune(batch_size=8)  # Instead of 16
```

### Training Too Slow:
```python
# Reduce epochs
finetuner.fine_tune(epochs=2)  # Instead of 3
```

### Need to Retrain:
```bash
# Delete old model
rm -rf models/finetuned-product-matcher/

# Run training again
python train_bert_model.py
```

## Re-training When Needed

Retrain the model when:
- ✅ You add 50+ new products to Odoo
- ✅ You change product naming conventions
- ✅ You add new product categories
- ✅ Customer terminology changes

Re-training takes 15-30 minutes and can be done anytime.

## Technical Details

**Algorithm**: Contrastive Learning with Cosine Similarity Loss
**Base Model**: Alibaba-NLP/gte-modernbert-base (768-dim embeddings)
**Training Data**: Auto-generated from product catalog
**Optimizer**: AdamW with learning rate warmup

## Summary

Fine-tuning transforms BERT from a generic language model into a **domain expert** for your specific products. It's like training a new employee on your product catalog!

**Result**: Higher accuracy, better confidence scores, fewer false positives.

**Time Investment**: 15-30 minutes one-time training → Permanent improvement in matching quality.
